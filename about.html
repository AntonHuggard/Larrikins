            <em>Larrikins</em> has a long and proud history.<br><br>
            It was first published in the prestigious <a href="https://www.salient.org.nz">Salient</a> (2018).
            It had the honour of appearing alongside Gus Mitchell's award-winning visual essay <em>Trigger Fin</em>. 
            Then, out of no where, the page reserved for the <em> Larrikins Christmas Special </em>
                was viciously snatched by the season finale of <em> Trigger Fin</em>.
            Ever since, <em>Trigger Fin</em> has been the sworn enemy of <em>Larrikins</em>. <br />
            <br /> 
            All the comics have been written and drawn by me. You're welcome.
