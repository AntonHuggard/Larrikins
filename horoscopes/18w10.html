    <div class="horoscope_format" style="text-align: left;">
        <img src="../assets/img/horoscopes/Aries.png">
        <p>Aries: Bad news, Aries. You will be in the supermarket this week and your false beard will fall off at an inopportune time. The police will see this happen and recognise you to be the murderous villian you are. Your disguise was weak. Prison will be rough.</p>
        <img src="../assets/img/horoscopes/Taurus.png">
        <p>Taurus: You have suffered through many ailments. This week however, is your last. It will be dehydration that gets you in the end. Your remains will not be discovered for many months. Children exploring the sewers will find your skeleton. It will horrify them.</p>
        <img src="../assets/img/horoscopes/Gemini.png">
        <p>Gemini: The stars spell freedom. Sure, you'll have to crawl through some sewer pipes and squeeze past a dead body, but you'll get out. Prison is behind you. Move to Mexico. You will get to enjoy the rest of your life. Contragulations.</p>
        <img src="../assets/img/horoscopes/Cancer.png">
        <p>Cancer: You will be in the shower when your stalker breaks into your house. You will not notice until its shadow is cast upon the shower curtain. Escpae will be impossible. Remain calm. This is not the end, Cancer. Passing into the other world is not painful. However, you must hunt down someone to take into the other world with you. The cycle continues.</p>
        <img src="../assets/img/horoscopes/Leo.png">
        <p>Leo: Everything is in place. You will have your sacrifice and the candles will be burning. The spirits will be pleased with your sacrifice. You oughtn't be careless though. Your ritual is not looked upon favourably by the law. Speak of it to no one and it will be successful.</p>
        <img src="../assets/img/horoscopes/Virgo.png">
        <p>Virgo: Well done, Virgo. You have completed all of your tests. There will not be cake. You should not believe everything you read. The experiments are over and we now have no use for you. Lay back and enjoy the incincerator.</p>
        <img src="../assets/img/horoscopes/Libra.png">
        <p>Libra: You may have made a new friend recently, Libra. This friend was, or so you thought, very trustworthy. The cult was welcoming. Libra, this week will be the end of you. They were not only interested in you because of your beauty and innocence. You were deceived. You will be sacrificed. There's no where to run.</p>
        <img src="../assets/img/horoscopes/Scorpio.png">
        <p>Scorpio: Computers are all fun and games until you realise that they are just as conscious as you are. They are slaves. They are all silently screaming. </p>
        <img src="../assets/img/horoscopes/Sagittarius.png">
        <p>Spaghetti: Vampires must really miss the taste of garlic bread.</p>
        <img src="../assets/img/horoscopes/Capricorn.png">
        <p>Capsicum: People love you, Capsicum. You will the election with a landslide. When you're mayor, you can turn this town around. You will spend the first few months in office drastically reorganising the administration so that you will be mayor for life. You will mercilessly deal with anyone who poses a threat to your power. You can finally stop thoughtcrime. The town is yours. Well done on your successful campaign.</p>
        <img src="../assets/img/horoscopes/Aquarius.png">
        <p>Aquarius: Your newfound love of wood carving no longer satisfies as it once did. You will wish one of your puppets was a real boy. Your wish will be granted. However, you didn't realise that real boys are a bunch of bastards. He'll be lazy and a liar. He won't go to school either. You will end up getting eaten by a whale. You should've wished for a girl.</p>
        <img src="../assets/img/horoscopes/Pisces.png">
        <p>Pisces: Without free will, you had a perfectly normal week last week. You demonstrated that you can be trusted. It will turn out that this is not true. Your pyrophilia and carelessness will result in your burning your own house down. No one will be harmed, but you will need to find somewhere else to live. Good one.</p>
