<div class="text_body">
    <h2>IX</h2>
    <div class="horoscope_format" style="text-align: left;">
        <img src="../assets/img/horoscopes/Aries.png">
        <p>Aries: Your life may have been somewhat turbulent recently, Aries. This is normal for people living under a false identity. Try not to worry, you're unrecognisable now. Besides, there's no going back to your old life anyway. <br></p>
        <img src="../assets/img/horoscopes/Taurus.png">
        <p>Taurus: The stars have not been kind to you Taurus. Hang on in there. Keep the peg on your nose and watch out for rats. Hypothermia, starvation and cholera haven't been fun, but at least you're not dead yet!</p>
        <img src="../assets/img/horoscopes/Gemini.png">
        <p>Gemini: Patience, Gemini. You have a hammer, but you mustn't be too hasty. Get something to hide your work. Escape is on the horizon but you have to keep moving towards it. Dig a little more each day.</p>
        <img src="../assets/img/horoscopes/Cancer.png">
        <p>Cancer: Your stalker is still after you, Cancer. You have been careless and you will pay the price. Make sure to never be out after dark and to lock your door. Be careful what you say. You never know what you might let slip that could cause your demise.</p>
        <img src="../assets/img/horoscopes/Leo.png">
        <p>Leo: The ritual is almost upon you, Leo. Make sure you bring a virgin and that your blade is sharpened.</p>
        <img src="../assets/img/horoscopes/Virgo.png">
        <p>Virgo: You are doing very well, Virgo. 76% of test subjects have not made it as far as you have. Make sure to keep the operational end of the device pointed away from your face. Avoid deep breaths around the fumes.</p>
        <img src="../assets/img/horoscopes/Libra.png">
        <p>Libra: Have you ever considered joining a cult, Libra? It would suit you. You'd, like, get to meet loads of interesting people. You'd get to learn all about a new belief system and be part of a community. Plus, you look really cute in a hood. You should hang out with Leo on the full moon.</p>
        <img src="../assets/img/horoscopes/Scorpio.png">
        <p>Scorpio: Scorpio, you may have been feeling a vague sense of unease and kidney loss recently. This is normal. You've only ever had one kidney. Huh? No, that thing sticking out of my bag is someone else's kidney. Haha Scorpio, you're so suspicious.</p>
        <img src="../assets/img/horoscopes/Sagittarius.png">
        <p>Spaghetti: The stars were kinda hard to read last time, it turns out you were going to be promoted, not fired. Oh well. At least you told that jerk of a boss what you really think of him. Also, make sure you find another job quickly, it looks like there's going to be a recession soon.</p>
        <img src="../assets/img/horoscopes/Capricorn.png">
        <p>Capsicum: Have you ever considered Egyptology as a career option? No? Huh. Weird. It seems like the sort of thing you might be interested in. Maybe you should try running for mayor. </p>
        <img src="../assets/img/horoscopes/Aquarius.png">
        <p>Aquarius: Your new job making wooden toys has had a really positive impact on your life. The villagers all respect your craft and the children all love your toys. You really should have started this sooner.</p>
        <img src="../assets/img/horoscopes/Pisces.png">
        <p>Pisces: Damn it, Pisces. You need to get this little habit of yours under control. Last week one of the buildings you burnt down still had people inside it. You're getting your free-will privileges revoked for this week to stop you from burning the whole town down.</p>
