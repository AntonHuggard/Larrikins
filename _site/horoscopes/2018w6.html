    <div class="horoscope_format" style="text-align: left;">
        <img src="../assets/img/horoscopes/Aries.png">
        <p>Aries: You have become the prime suspect. But they don't have solid 
            evidence. Don't speak without your lawyer lest you end up like
            Gemini.</p>
        <img src="../assets/img/horoscopes/Taurus.png">
        <p>Taurus: Your good fortune continues. Someone will flush a sombrero down the
            toilet this week. You may have been living on sewer rats for the last
            few weeks, but it will have all been worthwhile when you see how cool
            this hat is.</p>
        <img src="../assets/img/horoscopes/Gemini.png">
        <p>Gemini: Gemini: don't drop the soap<br></p>
        <img src="../assets/img/horoscopes/Cancer.png">
        <p>Cancer: You will realise that you don't know how bagels are made. Your thirst
            for knowledge will be forgotten when you are next at a computer. You
            will live in ignorance for the rest of your life<br></p>
        <img src="../assets/img/horoscopes/Leo.png">
        <p>Leo: You need to start gathering things for the ritual. Bloodstones are
            really cheap at this time of year. <br></p>
        <img src="../assets/img/horoscopes/Virgo.png">
        <p>Virgo: You may as well start getting used to being in a coffin now. You'll
            start spending a lot of time in one soon.<br></p>
        <img src="../assets/img/horoscopes/Libra.png">
        <p>Libra: more like le bra amirite! Thank you. I'm here all week.<br></p>
        <img src="../assets/img/horoscopes/Scorpio.png">
        <p>Scorpio: You've always wanted to solve crimes. You like doughnuts.
            Sign up for the New Zealand Police force today!<br></p>
        <img src="../assets/img/horoscopes/Sagittarius.png">
        <p>Spaghettarius: One of the people who will sit next to you on the bus is
            a maniac. You'll never guess which one<br></p>
        <img src="../assets/img/horoscopes/Capricorn.png">
        <p>Capricorn: You will experience some strange new feelings. Don't panic. I
            know it's scary, but agreeing with Winston Peters is a normal,
            healthy part of growing up. One day you'll get a gold card too.</p>
        <img src="../assets/img/horoscopes/Aquarius.png">
        <p>Aquarius: you must flee at once<br></p>
        <img src="../assets/img/horoscopes/Pisces.png">
        <p>Pies: You're young and want to experiment. That's normal. Just make sure
            that the fires don't get out of control.</p>
